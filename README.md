#Printf Function
The printf function is a C standard library that formats and print data to the standard output. This repository is our own implementation of the printf function. This implementation will help us gain a deeper understanding of the C language in general, and how the printf function works. So, it is a great learning experience, as we solidify the main concepts of the C programming language.

## Our\_Printf Function Prototype
The function of our printf function will declare our function's name: `our\_printf`, the return type: `int`, and the parameters: one or more arguments can be passed into the function through variable arguments.

```C
int our_printf(const char *format, ...);
```
